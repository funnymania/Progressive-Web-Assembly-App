# Progressive Web Assembly App (PWAA)
The following is a Unity WebGL app compiled to webassembly, run in a progressive web app.

This experiment will take place with a very simple 3D game, in which you can just run around a little. 

As a PWA, we are looking to get this working on iOS / Android, as well as the desktop space. 

First we will develop the PWA, then the Unity WebGl app, and more complicated things will follow from there. 

# Gotchas!
1. Do not run `vue build`. 
Instead, cd to project root and `npm run build`.
