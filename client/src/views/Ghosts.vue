    inviting fellow ghosts to ideate and develop with on a new scene:
    <br><br><br>
    disrupting the current application ecosystem...
    <br><br>
    space.
    <br><br>
    This will be accomplished by writing 'ghost apps', and ghost app factories. The 
    factories will allow anyone to <em>very</em> easily create simple 
    webassembly-based apps. You decide what it does, and whoever you share it with
    can use it for that purpose with you. You effectively create and then share a 
    link for your app.
    <br><br>
    For instance, a secret channel for messaging. 
    <br><br>
    These apps will run via browsers on any device. 
    These apps will not be hosted on the app store, or 
    the play store, although the factory app will. 
    <br><br>
    These applications will run p2p via a decentralized network, bringing
    your device back into the hands of a true ghost, who does not need to 
    live within the era of corporately defined behavior patterns-IMEAN 
    <em>transcends</em> the physical world's barriers.
