    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp;the goal is to get people
      <br>to stop applying for jobs obsessively
      <br>and companies to stop posting
      <br>jobs in the traditional fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;by satirizing the pursuit
      <br>as a pokemon trading card game,
      <br>gachapon, or otherwise endless
      <br>quest to Catch 'em ALL!
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;All cards die fast to reflect
      <br>the hopelessness in returned opportunities
      <br>to recently applied for positions.
