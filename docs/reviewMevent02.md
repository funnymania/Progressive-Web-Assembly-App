Fixes
[] - 'Conflicts' does not (visibally?) move to queue from stack
      Instead, when cycling, 'I am empty' moves to stack. 
      Popping 'I am empty' does nothing
[] - ExplainationBox: Click outside to hide

Design
[] - Need a global logo / something to click back to home
[] - black fade out when modal for Sharing stack and help explanations
      pop up
[] - New Thing text box needs sleeker styling
[] - Add 'Why' explanation url for why this only provides limited options
[] - Limit capacity from 3 - 5
[] - Stylize scrollbar on explanationbox
[] - Stylize scrollbars an queue items

Code
[] - Read from localStorage to save values, not the backingData. 
[] - share-url-box should be a general box for pop-up dialogs
[] - scss for setting variables (like background-color = black, etc)
