Fixes
[] - 'Conflicts' does not (visibally?) move to queue from stack
      Instead, when cycling, 'I am empty' moves to stack. 
      Popping 'I am empty' does nothing
[] - ExplainationBox: Click outside to hide
[] - capacity should be displaying current capacity

Design
[] - Need a global logo / something to click back to home
[] - black fade out when modal for Sharing stack and help explanations
      pop up
[] - New Thing text box needs sleeker styling
[] - Add 'Why' explanation url for why this only provides limited options
[] - Limit capacity from 3 - 5
[] - Stylize scrollbar on explanationbox
[] - Stylize scrollbars an queue items
[] - Plasma lamp inside spinner
[] - spinner timing is off, arrows don't look correct
[] on lowering capcity, which will be via + and - buttons, capcity cannot be lowered unless there is something empty in the queue. 
[] - queue entry should not grow completely freely (will take up most of screen if other entries are empty

Code
[] - Read from localStorage to save values, not the backingData. 
[] - share-url-box should be a general box for pop-up dialogs
[] - scss for setting variables (like background-color = black, etc)
