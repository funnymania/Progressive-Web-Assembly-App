TODO: Stub out data+logic pipeline for effeckds.

Theauxts
--
This is where you pick up status effeckds. Will link out to 
separate app status effeckds (angular).

Since we will have effectively three different apps, with one
underlying backend, will need to consider optimizations for 
scaling through AWS after beta release. 


2 am slekshun: jokL
--
This is our unityApp, 2 am slekshun: jokL.
Links to a page which will load in the application.
Application should be stretched to full screen.
This will talk with Theauxts and the hub app. 

noSCL
--
This is a reference to the projects' omon in the noSCL app. 
If you have the app installed, it will be opened. 
If not, the user will be taken to the application page.
They will be asked to login here, there will be a link to
instructions for logging in.
Right now, no email is required (although your username can be your email).
We are going to be using something like trip codes for users. 
For now, security is "head-less". If you do not remember your password, you are unable to log-in. Will raise an issue about this
when development for this application begins.

omon will actually bring in your status effeckd and "color" it for you.
